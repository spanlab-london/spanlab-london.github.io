István Zoltán Kiss is a Professor in the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University London . His research is at the interface of network science, dynamical systems and stochastic processes, and concerns both theoretical and data-driven problems. Examples include network inference, exactness of mean-field models, temporal and higher-order networks, adaptive/dynamic networks, resilience of power networks and the study of spreading processes in general.
