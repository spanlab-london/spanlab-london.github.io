Andrés is a PhD student at the Network Science Institute, supervised by Prof. István Kiss. His research focuses on uncovering the influence of structural characteristics in epidemic data, both in the context of higher-order networks and through inference techniques aimed at revealing structural properties from observed dynamics. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and a Master’s degree in Computational Mathematics from the University of São Paulo.
