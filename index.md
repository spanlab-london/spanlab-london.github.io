# Welcome to SPAN Lab

The SPAN Lab investigates how contagion—biological, social, or technological—spreads through complex networks. Using tools from graph theory, stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and statistical inference, we reveal how structure drives dynamics. Our research combines mathematical depth with practical impact, advancing both fundamental understanding and applied solutions across domains from public health to technology.
